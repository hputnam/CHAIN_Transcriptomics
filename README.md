To test the effects of chronic, ecologically relevant nutrient enrichment on coral and symbiont gene expression we conducted a 5-week continuous dosing experiment on the Hawaiian coral Pocillopora acuta. We acclimated coral fragments to 5 nutrient concentrations (0.1-7 Î¼mol L-1 NO3- with constant stoichiometry 2.5:1 NO3- to PO4).
