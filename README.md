Chronic nutrient enrichment can have impacts on the coral holobiont ranging from symbiont enhancement to exacerbating coral bleaching and reducing coral grwoth.
Here we assessed the effects of chronic, ecologically relevant nutrient enrichment on coral and symbiont gene expression on the Hawaiian coral Pocillopora acuta. To this end we conducted a 5-week continuous dosing experiment, where P. acuta was exposed 5 nutrient concentrations with constant stoichiometry 2.5:1 NO3-:PO4 at the levels of 0.1, 1, 3, 5, AND 7 Î¼mol L-1 NO3-. After 5 weeks of exposure that resulted in increased symbiont cell densities and photochemical efficiency of the symbiont ta higher nutrient concentrations, but no directional effect on growth across the gradient, P. acuta fragments were snap frozen for gene expression analysis. RNA was isolated and sampled were sequenced single end read 75bp on the Illumina NextSeq.
